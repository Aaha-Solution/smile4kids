                    <p>At Smile 4 Kids (“we”/ “us”/ “our”), keeping students/pupils safe continues to be our top priority. We have a primary and continuing responsibility for the care, welfare and safety of all pupils in our charge. In this context of remote learning, we are exceptionally mindful of the requirement to adhere to strict protocols for online teaching and learning from home so as to ensure pupil security.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this Policy is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Provide appropriate health and safety guidelines with regards to online learning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ensure that health and safeguarding measures are taken seriously by all members of staff, children and their parents during online learning.

                        <li>
                            Ensure all children have the provision they need to complete their work to the best of their ability, and to remain happy, healthy, and supported during online learning.

                    <p>“Safeguarding” has been defined by the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) as the action that is taken to promote children’s welfare and protect them from harm. Child protection is part of the safeguarding process. It focusses on protecting individual children who might be at risk of harm.</p>

                    <p>Smile 4 Kids is committed to safeguarding and protecting all children.</p>
                    <p>Some of the Safeguarding and child protection policies and procedures that we follow include:</p>
                    <p>a. Recruitment of suitable staff and volunteers: We follow safe recruitment principles which include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We short-list candidates that best match the job description published by us
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We interview only short-listed candidates, always ensuring that the candidate being interviewed continues to match our recruitment requirements
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We carry out DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks at the required level
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We obtain at-least 2 (two) references in respect of a candidate that we have interviewed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We verify a potential candidate’s right to remain and work in the United Kingdom
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            We do not confirm employment until we have received a satisfactory DBS check report, and satisfactory feedback from the referees
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>b. Child Protection Training: We constantly emphasise on and remind our staff and volunteers about our commitment to keep children and young people safe within the online space that we provide them. We ensure that all staff and volunteers complete the child protection training as part of the induction process, which includes training on online safety as well as the procedures to be followed if a child protection concern is identified.</p>
                    <p>c. Supervision of New Staff and Volunteers: New staff are always supervised at regular intervals, by Senior staff, as well as, Safrina Saran</p>
                    <p>d. Use of suitable platforms and devices</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            We only use platforms that have been trialled by us, and that have proved to be suitable for the use by children we are teaching.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Smile 4 Kids teachers will never use their personal accounts to conduct any courses and/or to communicate with children, young people or their Parents. Courses will always be conducted and children, young people or their Parents will always receive all communications from an authorised Smile 4 Kids’ account, created and managed exclusively for the purposes of delivering courses and carrying out communication with the students and/or their Parents.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We also ensure that we turn on and regularly check the privacy settings on the account that we are using to interact with children and young people.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            to the extent possible, we use organisational, i.e. Smile 4 Kids’ devices to communicate with children and young people. However, in a remote teaching set-up, it may not always be possible for teachers to have access to an organisational device. In such circumstances, the founder and supervisor of Smile 4 Kids, Mrs. Safrina Saran, will on a case-by case basis, authorise certain teachers and volunteers to use a personal device, and will keep a record of this authorisation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            teachers and volunteers who have been authorised to use a personal device for the purposes of delivering courses and communicating with children and young people must adhere to the following rules:
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We only use platforms that have been trialled by us, and that have proved to be suitable for the use by children we are teaching.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            We also ensure that we turn on and regularly check the privacy settings on the account that we are using to interact with children and young people.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>e. Use of cameras for live classes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Our teachers will have their cameras on while teaching, as our teaching methods include several activities and interactive techniques such as quizzes and games.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While cameras are on, teachers will ensure that:
                        </li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>there is never any risk of strangers having access to the screen</li>
                            <li>they are dressed appropriately</li>
                            <li>they conduct lessons in a quiet space, ensuring that friends and family are never visible during a lesson</li>
                            <li>Check what is visible on screen to the student(s), so that nothing inappropriately personal is visible (such as personal items, posters, etc.)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            While we prefer students to have their cameras on during a class, we understand that some children or Parents may not be comfortable having their cameras/webcams on. If a child is shy or for any reason not comfortable turning on their webcam, or you as a Parent have concerns relating to the use of a webcam by your child please discuss the situation with us.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Please note that a student will be asked to use their webcam only for the purposes of participating in class activities and not for any other purpose. In addition every student must be supervised by a Parent for the duration of their online class with us.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Please note that Parents must fill out a consent form, expressly consenting to their children attending online classes delivered by us and including, without limitation the use of cameras during the online class.

                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>

                            <li>

                            <li>
                                Before we record a class we will expressly seek the consent of the children participating in the class, and if a child or children show hesitation or are uncomfortable with us making a recording, we will not proceed to make the recording
                            </li>
                            <li> A child or Parent may at any time withdraw consent in relation to the recording of our online classes. If a child or parent withdraws consent after a recording has been made, we will ensure that we dispose of the recording securely.</li>
                            <li>We understand that a recording may constitute personal data relating to children and our staff or volunteers. We take the privacy of our staff, volunteers, students and their Parents very seriously and will only record classes on receipt of prior consent from the parties involved. We will ensure that any such recordings made are stored securely on password protected systems and only authorised persons have access to such recordings. We will also ensure that should we have to dispose of a recording, we will do so in the most secure manner possible, ensuring that the recording as well as any back-up copies if any, are deleted from the system and/or any hard-drive or devices.</li>

                            Please note that as a strict policy, as long as our staff and/or volunteers are working with us, they will not send nor accept any friend requests on their personal accounts from students, children, young people and their families.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a student, child, young person, their Parents or families find that our staff or volunteers have tried connecting with them via social media in breach of their obligations under this policy please report the concerned individual immediately to Safrina Saran.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Given that children, young people and/or their families may look up the personal social media accounts of our staff and volunteers, we constantly remind our staff and volunteers to be aware of their digital footprint, and to keep their social media accounts free of inappropriate or harmful content, and not to provide any personal information such as personal email addresses or phone numbers via their social media accounts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Please note that a member of staff or volunteer should never request children or young people to share their pictures and/or videos. If a picture or video has to be taken for a class activity, parents will be served a written notice, requesting for express consent. If a member of staff or volunteer requests a child or young person for their pictures or videos, without having sought consent from the Parent, please report the concerned individual immediately to Safrina Saran

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Sometimes a member of staff or volunteer may have to contact a student over 18 (eighteen) years of age or a student’s Parent, in relation to their homework or to check on a student’s well-being.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A member of staff or volunteer will contact a student or a Parent only during hours which would be considered normal school hours, via the Parent’s email address or phone number given to us as the contact details to be used for such purposes, unless this poses a safeguarding risk.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            We take the wellbeing of children and young people enrolled onto our courses seriously and therefore if a member of our staff sees or hears something worrying during an online lesson, or if a child discloses abuse during a phone call or via email, we may if necessary contact the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) who will take the necessary action to protect the child or young person
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We constantly remind our staff and volunteers to be more vigilant if a child or young person has Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), as such children are often more vulnerable. Our child protection lead and Designated Safeguarding Person is Safrina Saran.
