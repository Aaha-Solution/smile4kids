                    <h5 class="card-title Violet" style="font-weight: bold;">Child abuse and neglect :</h5>
                    <p>Child abuse is any form of physical, emotional or sexual mistreatment or lack of care that leads to injury or harm. An individual may abuse or neglect a child directly, or by failing to protect them from harm. Some forms of child abuse and neglect are listed below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Emotional abuse is the persistent emotional maltreatment of a child so as to cause severe and persistent adverse effects on the child’s emotional development. It may involve making the child feel that they are worthless, unloved, or inadequate. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of maltreatment of a child, though it may occur alone.</li>
                        <li>Physical abuse can involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning, drowning,suffocating or otherwise causing physical harm to a child. Physical harm may be also caused when a parent or carer feigns the symptoms of, or deliberately causes, ill health to a child.</li>
                        <li>Sexual abuse involves forcing or enticing a child to take part in sexual activities, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. This can involve physical contact, or non-contact activities such as showing children sexual activities or encouraging them to behave in sexually inappropriate ways.</li>
                        <li>Neglect is the persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and emotional needs. It can involve a failure to provide adequate food, clothing and shelter, to protect a child from physicaland emotional harm, to ensure adequate supervision or to allow access to medical treatment.</li>

                    <h5 class="card-title Violet" style="font-weight: bold;">Signs of possible abuse and neglect may include:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>significant changes in a child's behaviour</li>
                        <li>deterioration in a child’s general well-being</li>
                        <li>unexplained bruising or marks</li>
                        <li>comments made by a child which give cause for concern</li>

                        <li>inappropriate behaviour displayed by a member of staff, or any other person. For example,inappropriate sexual comments, excessive one-to-one attention beyond the requirements of their role, or inappropriate sharing of images.</li>

                    <h5 class="card-title Violet" style="font-weight: bold;">If abuse is suspected or disclosed:</h5>
                    <p>When a child makes a disclosure to a member of staff, that member of staff will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>preassure the child that they were not to blame and were right to speak out</li>
                        <li>listen to the child but not question them</li>
                        <li>give reassurance that the staff member will act on the disclosure</li>
                        <li>record the incident as soon as possible (see Logging an incident below)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>If a member of staff witnesses or suspects abuse, they will record the incident straightaway. If a third-party expresses concern that a child is being abused, we will encourage them to contact Social Care directly. If they will not do so, we will explain that the Club is obliged to and the incident will be logged accordingly.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title Violet" style="font-weight: bold;">Peer-on-peer abuse:</h5>
                    <p>Children are vulnerable to abuse by their peers. Peer-on-peer abuse is taken seriously by staff and will be subject to the same child protection procedures as other forms of abuse. Staff are aware of the potential uses of information technology for bullying and abusive behaviour between young people.</p>
                    <p>Staff will not dismiss abusive behaviour as normal between young people. The presence of one or more of the following in relationships between children should always trigger concern about the possibility of peer-on-peer abuse:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sexual activity (in primary school-aged children) of any kind, including sexting</li>
                        <li>One of the children is significantly more dominant than the other(s) (e.g. much older)</li>
                        <li>One of the children is significantly more vulnerable than the other(s) (e.g. in terms of disability, confidence, physical strength)</li>
                        <li>There has been some use of threats, bribes or coercion to ensure compliance or secrecy. If peer-on-peer abuse is suspected or disclosed, we will follow the same procedures as set out above for responding to child abuse.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>All childcare settings have a legal duty to protect children from the risk of radicalisation and being drawn into extremism. There are many reasons why a child might be vulnerable to radicalisation,including:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>feeling alienated or alone</li>
                        <li>seeking a sense of identity or individuality</li>
                        <li>suffering from mental health issues such as depression</li>
                        <li>desire for adventure or wanting to be part of a larger cause</li>
                        <li>associating with others who hold extremist beliefs-3</li>

                    <p>Signs that a child might be at risk of radicalisation include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>changes in behaviour, for example becoming withdrawn or aggressive</li>

                        <li>possessing or sharing violent extremist material</li>


                    </ul>
                    <p>If a member of staff suspects that a child is at risk of becoming radicalised, they will record any relevant information or observations on a Logging a concern form, and refer the matter to the DSP.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title Violet" style="font-weight: bold;">Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE):</h5>
                    <p>Occurs where an individual or a group takes advantage of an imbalance of power to coerce, manipulate or deceive a child (under 18) into sexual activity in exchange for:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Something the victim wants / needs</li>
                        <li>For financial advantage or increased status of the perpetrator Child Sexual Exploitation does not always involve physical contact; it can also occur using technology. Definition from DfE: February 2017</li>



                    </ul>
                    <p>CSE may occur in conjunction with criminal activity. Indicators can include the child being in possession of unexplained ‘gifts’, problematic or inappropriate sexual behaviour for their age.If a member of staff suspects that a child’s behaviour indicates CSE, they will record any relevant information or observations on a Logging a concern form, and refer the matter to the DSP.</p>
