            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;text-align:center;color:#8943a7">ABOUT ME</h3>
            <div class="col-sm-8 p-4 text fs-4" style="margin-top: 50px;">
                <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">HOW AND WHY IT STARTED</h3>
                <p> I'm Safrina and I’m passionate about Teaching Indian Languages</p>

                <p> I’m a qualified Teacher, with over 18 years of experience in English Schools, in the UK</p>

                <p> My vision is to make learning languages Fun, Enjoyable and Engaging, for all students</p>

                <p> I’m a mother of 2 beautiful girls</p>

                <p> I was born in England, but am a true proud Panjabi at heart</p>

                <p> I have Bsc and Msc in Economics and Politics, plus a Post Grad Teaching Qualification ( University of London and City University)</p>

                <p> What can I say, I LOVE Education!</p>

                <p>I am the Creator/ Writer/ Owner of S.M.I.L.E 4 Kids Indian Language School</p>

                <p> S.M.I.L.E stands for Speak my Indian Language Easily</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">‘MY PASSION’</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;font-weight:400 ;">
                <p> is to keep our Mother Tongue alive, through our children</p>

                <p> Most of all, I really want grandparents, parents and children, to LOVE to SPEAK their Mother Tongue and to fall in love with our Culture and Identity</p>

                <p> We are so used to speaking English, (as it’s convenient), that we are in imminent danger of losing, our languages and therefore our identity</p>
                <p> I want to make, speaking our Mother Tongue, just as easy too</p>

                <p> This is why I have carefully and lovingly, written and created a fun and unique way, for our children to learn to Speak and/or Write Panjabi, Hindi and Gujarati</p>

                <p> Family and Roots, mean everything to me, as this is what truly defines and identifies us</p>

                </p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">‘MY BACKGROUND’</h3>
                <p> I took 10 years out of my teaching career, to have our 2 beautiful girls</p>

                <p> For the first 7 years of our marriage, we faced lots of struggles to start a family</p>

                <p>After a bad miscarriage in 2008, we were told that it’s near enough impossible to conceive, by medics and astrologers and anyone we seeked help from</p>

                <p>On top of this, my beloved mother and father passed away, very suddenly and in quick succession of each other</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">LIFE LESSON </h3>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">NEVER GIVE UP! TRUST YOUR INTENT AND HEART</h3>
                <p> It was sheer determination and sending out positive signals to the universe, that made our dream come true</p>

                <p> It took 7 long, hard years to have our 1st daughter, then another 4 years to have our second daughter</p>

                <p> Our girls are both true miracles and proof that if you ’Dare to Dream’, your dream will come true</p>

                <p> I still wake up each morning and count my blessings</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">‘WHY I STARTED MY BUSINESS’</h3>
                <p> in 2018, once the girls were in school, I was ready to go back to work</p>

                <p> I really wanted to do something really meaningful in life, break barriers and make a difference</p>

                <p> Most of all, i wanted to give something back, as I felt truly blessed</p>

                <p> My inspiration was and still is, my dear late, beloved mother and my best friend in life</p>

                <p> Children were her life and children are my life</p>

                <p> In addition, by becoming a parent myself, I realised that parents are the biggest ‘influencers’, in children’s lives</p>

                <p> I realised that my girls, had never seen their mum have a career</p>

                <p> This light bulb moment came when 4 years ago, I asked my 7 year old, ‘What do you want to do when you grow up?'</p>

                <p> Her answer was, 'I want to stay at home cook, clean and do housework'</p>

                <p> I had to show my girls that, women are just as powerful as men and have careers and success, in their own right</p>
                <p>

                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">‘HOW I STARTED MY BUSINESS’</h3>
                <p>4 years ago, I was struggling to teach my own girls, then 3 and 7 years, to Speak Panjabi. It felt like a daunting prospect</p>

                <p> Mum in law ( who lives with us ), opted to speak English to them</p>

                <p> Whilst enjoying a lovely holiday in Dubai, I decided, it was time to get some help</p>

                <p> So I took them to our local Gurudwara, to learn Panjabi</p>

                <p> I was super excited, as you know, I love Education and Learning</p>

                <p> Much to my dismay, teaching there lacked Structure, there was no focus on Speaking ( my main aim ), Large groups of children and classes were 3 hours long!</p>

                <p> Most of all there was no Fun element!!</p>

                <p> That’s when I decided that, it was time for change!!</p>

                <p> I used my skills as a Teacher and a Mother and started creating Fun ways, to teach my own children, Panjabi</p>

                <p> I wrote and created my own Educational Songs, as songs are incredibly powerful and easy way of retaining learning</p>

                <p> I made my own flashcards and resources and my girls loved learning and grew in confidence, very quickly</p>

                <p> We had lots of fun while learning. It was easy!</p>

                <p> So much so, that other parents started asking me to teach their children Panjabi</p>

                <p> As word spread, I was asked to offer Hindi, then Gujarati classes</p>

                <p> Any small profit that I made initially, I re invested in hiring a Music Producer to make professional music, designers to create my flashcards.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I hired an IT company in India ( tight budget ),to build a new website, with an admin portal to share my resources, with students</p>

                <p> I wanted to offer the highest quality to my students, even if it meant using all my profits and putting in some of my savings</p>

                <p> I also wanted to help parents to give them structure and tips to apply learning at home</p>

                <p> Speaking a second language to English, must be FAMILY AFFAIR, not just 1 hour class a week</p>

                <p> I adapted to Lockdown in April 2020, by offering Online Zoom classes</p>

                <p>It was the single best decision I made!!!</p>

                <p>I have hired and trained,10 wonderful and equally enthusiastic teachers to help me</p>
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">‘MY BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT’</h3>
                <p>is still becoming a mum to my 2 children and holding them close</p>

                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">‘MY REWARDS’</h3>
                <p>Inspiring my 2 daughters to follow their passions and be strong independent women in future

                <p>To see them being proud of their mum’s achievements and be inspired by me, is truly the cherry on top</p>

                <p> Helping Families to connect and fall in Love with their culture and Languages.</p>

                <p> I’m truly overwhelmed, each time I receive a positive message from a parent .. just like it’s the first time.</p>

                <p>It truly fills my heart with emotion, to know that my course has made a difference to even just one child or family or grandparent</p>

                <p>I look forward to connecting with you all and most of all,</p>

                <p>I salute all women and wish you all every success in life</p>

                <p>I equally salute and <span class="colred">CELEBRATE </span>all men , such as my dear husband, that support their wives as equals</p>

                <p>I really appreciate everyone, for taking the time to ready my story</p>
